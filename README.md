I used HMTL and CSS to make this personal website happen.




Step 1: As you open the file, you will see my homepage. There are five social media icons, and if you hover over the arrow, the name of the social media will pop up. If you click the Facebook icon, it will direct you to my Facebook account, just like the other icons, according to what social media it is.

Step 2: Moving on to my About page, you can see my personal details, such as my name, address, date of birth, email, phone number, and educational background.

Step 3: Next is my portfolio; it shows six buttons that contain my past projects in descending order. The blood donation system is the latest project, and on the bottom, you can see the senior high school activities that I made.

Step 4: For the interest page, it shows that I like books, traveling, and music.

Step 5: The skill page shows the history and the percentage of the four programming languages that I know.

Step 6: The recommendation page shows the must reads, must visits, must try foods, and must watch movies according to the internet. If you click the text inside the box, it will lead you to the page that I linked to.
